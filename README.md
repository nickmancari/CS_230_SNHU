- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client wanted a game with the ability to save components that would customize the game play and afford the user a profile. They wanted a client-server model that would give flexibility to the application of the software.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Having familiarity with both frontend and backend paradigms made it easy for me to assess how certain things would get accomplished. Also, some familiarity with Linux operating systems was very helpful when comparing the application of the software.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having a strategy outlined when assessing the architecture was very helpful when considering the code design. For instance, having a plan for storage made considering how the program handles reading and writing stored objects a lot easier.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the explanations for components such as storage and memory. I would add additional information and a deeper context and explain the differences a little more thoroughly.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Building a product based on user needs is a core component to the agile process. Collecting information from the user to gain insight into what they would use within a software project is vital to the construction and roadmap of how to build out the project.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Planing an approach with a UML or pseudocode was instrumental when devising a structure for completing this project. A UML was particularly helpful when trying to visualize the map of how each working part relates to each other in the structure of the software.
